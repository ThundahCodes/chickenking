Fast Food Landing Page with Bootstrap 5.2

This is a small project where I did a fake fast food website. The website is fully responsive and has the idea of being an action based landing page, so to make the user order and contact the fast food.

Everything is written in the .html file beacuse I felt lazy to do it in more than one file, and also don't mind the image names/extra images I was extra messy this time around tbh.
